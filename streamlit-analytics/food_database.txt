1. Data Quality Improvements

Add a unique identifier: A Meal_ID or Row_ID column for easier referencing.

Standardize units:

Calories in kcal (currently fine).

Sodium → keep as mg, but maybe add a converted column in % of daily RDA.

Protein/Fat/Carbs → already in grams (good).

Serving size: Include Serving_Size (e.g., 1 cup, 100g, 2 pieces) to make comparisons fair.

Meal tags: Add tags like “Veg/Non-Veg”, “Processed/Whole”, “Dairy”, “Fruit”.

2. Additional Nutritional Attributes

If your food dataset supports it, add columns like:

Cholesterol (mg)

Saturated Fat (g) vs. Unsaturated Fat (g)

Potassium (mg)

Calcium (mg)

Vitamin C, A, D (mg or IU)

These help make your dashboard feel more “advanced” and allow deeper analysis.

3. Contextual Metadata

Day Type: Workday/Weekend (so you can compare patterns).

Meal Timing (numeric): Convert Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner into time ranges (e.g., 8:30, 13:00). Helps in time-series visualizations.

User Info: If personalized, add User_ID, Gender, Age, Weight, Height → useful for calculating daily recommended intake.

4. Analytical Enhancements

% Daily Value Columns: Auto-compute each nutrient as a % of recommended daily intake (RDA). For example:

Calories (2000 kcal baseline)

Protein (50 g)

Fat (70 g)

Sodium (2300 mg)

Meal totals per day: Add pre-aggregated daily totals in a summary table (good for trend charts).
